# Katyusha
Assignment #1 Computer Graphics Period 5 (Se√±or Dyrland-Weaver)


If you wanna see a successful Swiss flag (tried to do Red Army flag but idk how to do diagonals), just change the makefile to "python swiss_flag.py", I'm just warning you that this takes a long time to compile (I'd give it about 4-6 minutes).  That's why I didn't do it for this assignment.  If you want proof that I made it though, just try it.
