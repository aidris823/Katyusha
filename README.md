# Katyusha
Assignment #1 Computer Graphics Period 5 (Se√±or Dyrland-Weaver)
If you wanna see a successful Swiss flag, just change the makefile to "python swiss_flag.py", I'm just warning you that this takes a long time to compile.  That's why I didn't do it for this assignment.  If you want proof that I made it though, just try it.
